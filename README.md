# star-wars-scroll-wordpress-plugin

This plugin will add the opening scoll from episode 4: a new hope to your wordpress site with the shortcode [starwarsscroll]. The scroll comes from the good folks at The Star Wars API (swapi.com). 

I am using this plugin to learn unit testing using wp-cli and phpunit.
